" "Makes stockpiles better" " - Mehni

Stockpiles prefer certain items, but if none are available, allows others.

---

Set multiple ranked filters for stockpiles, to prefer some items over others. Only the highest ranked items will be put in the stockpile, but if you don't have those available, lower ranks will be allowed.

This enables a zone to allow only Lavish Meals, but when they are not available, other meals are still allowed.

Same with kibble  hay  veggies.

(There are probably other applications than food ranking.)

---

Lower-ranked filters have to include everything that higher ranked filters do. So when you try to disable an item in the filter and nothing happens, it's probably because a higher rank allows that item.

There's a toggle that makes sure to replace lower-ranked items with higher-ranked items when they become available. It is worse for performance though.

The tiniest technical detail: this also fixes a bug where, after loading, changing a storage filter wouldn't update the hauling system, (and changing the HP/quality wouldn't ever update)

Yea it's incompatible with Extended Storage, but I don't use that. Anyone can look at the source and find out how to fix that, or you gotta wait for my generosity to make something that I'll never use work.
